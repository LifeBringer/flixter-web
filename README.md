### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, asynchronous calls and the variants were essential for the success of this project. The pacing from html, css, and finally javascript was helpful in building up understanding of how to piece items together. The strech goals such as 'hover' should have been fleshed out better.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
With more time, I would like to implement an applicable dark mode framework.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

It went well.
